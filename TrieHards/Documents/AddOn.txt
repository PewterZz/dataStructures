How we used C++ builder:  
C++ builder is the IDE we used to make the GUI for our program. Using C++ builder was not easy, but also not too hard. In C++ builder the first thing to do is  
build the design of our GUI by using the fmx file that is provided. In the fmx file we can place and edit the properties of various C++ builder items. Specific actions  
can be linked with code to perform a specific action we executed. To directly contact any of the items in the GUI we can call the Dictionary object and access the other  
objects within that form afterwards. For example Dictionary->ListBox will lead us to the listbox of the program which is the box in the middle that we used to display  
all of the dictionary items. Within the listbox object there is another object called items which has a function called Add(). This function can be used to add items into  
the listbox, Dictionary->Listbox->Items->Add(). This is just one example of many of the other techniques that were used during the production of our program.
