Array struct is faster for searching only when the length to search is small, hash table is fast for searching no matter the sample size with minimal collisions.  
Array struct still has to search through an entire list of structures to find the required data while hsahing can acquire us the address simply through the  
hash function.
Time complexity of a hash table lookup is O(1) on an average case , while for the array of struct it has a time complexity of O(n).
