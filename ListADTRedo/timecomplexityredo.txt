1. AddLaptop() = time complexity of adding a laptop to the contact list is O(1) because it immediately adds to the end of the list without searching.
2. DisplayLaptopStock() = time complexity of this is O(n) as it needs to loop through all of the elements of the list structure.
3. SellLaptop() = time complexity of the sell function is O(n) although there are multiple other while loops to make the user experience better so in actuality time complexity  
of my sell function is about O(n^3).
